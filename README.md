> ERC-1155-based Exchange

LPs are tracked under [multi-token standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155).

Swapping is routed from this same contract. Easy peasy.

Math is handled by external helper contracts called `swapper`.

Currently, pairs are supported. Can use raw ETH too.

## To-do
- [X] Core contracts
- [X] XYK swapper
- [ ] Concentrated swapper
